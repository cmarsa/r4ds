# Chapter 21 R Markdown
To produce a complete report containing all text, code, and results,
click “Knit” or press `Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-K`. You can also do this pro‐
grammatically with `rmarkdown::render("1-example.Rmd")` . This
will display the report in the viewer pane, and create a self-contained
HTML file that you can share with others.

When you knit the document R Markdown sends the `.Rmd` file to
knitr, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new
Markdown (`.md`) document that includes the code and its output.
The Markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by __pandoc__,
which is responsible for creating the finished file. The advantage of
this two-step workflow is that you can create a very wide range of
output formats, as you’ll learn about in Chapter 23.
